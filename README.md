# Shakespearean Networks
## This project is an exploration of networks embedded in Shakespeare's plays through character dialogue.
### The consistent structure of plays including stage directions helps faciliate the necessary data mining. For instance, the acts and scenes generally begin with text such as 'Scene I. Venice. A street.' and each character's part starts with 'PUCK. How now, spirit! Whither wander you?'

### The plays included in this project are:
- Romeo and Juliet
- Hamlet
- Othello, the Moor of Venice
- Julius Caesar
- A Midsummer Night's Dream
- Macbeth

### The texts are all sourced from Project Gutenberg.

### The majority of the analysis is completed in NetworkX.

### Below is a visualization of the largest component based on character dialogue in Julius Caesar. The sizes of the nodes reflect how frequently a character speaks and the width of the edges reflect the frequency of turns between the two characters.
