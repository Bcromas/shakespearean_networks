So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark\u2019d about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body.

I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved. \u2019Twas Aeneas\u2019 tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam\u2019s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th\u2019 Hyrcanian beast,\u2014_ It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\u2014 _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear\u2019d With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick\u2019d With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak\u2019d and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o\u2019ersized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks._ So, proceed you."], ["POLONIUS", ". \u2019Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion."], ["FIRST PLAYER", ". _Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command. Unequal match\u2019d, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Th\u2019unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus\u2019 ear. For lo, his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019air to stick. So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing But as we often see against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus\u2019 pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work, And never did the Cyclops\u2019 hammers fall On Mars\u2019s armour, forg\u2019d for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus\u2019 bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.

And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What\u2019s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damn\u2019d defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i\u2019 th\u2019 throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha! \u2019Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver\u2019d, and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave\u2019s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Oh vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder\u2019d, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon\u2019t! Foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim\u2019d their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I\u2019ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I\u2019ll observe his looks; I\u2019ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil, and the devil hath power T\u2019assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I\u2019ll have grounds More relative than this. The play\u2019s the thing Wherein I\u2019ll catch the conscience of the King."]]}, "ACT III": {"SCENE I": [["KING", ".

The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye; nor \u2019tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change, For \u2019tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, The poor advanc\u2019d makes friends of enemies; And hitherto doth love on fortune tend: For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy.

I embrace it freely, And will this brother\u2019s wager frankly play.\u2014 Give us the foils; come on."], ["LAERTES", ". Come, one for me."], ["HAMLET", ". I\u2019ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i\u2019 th\u2019 darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed."], ["LAERTES", ". You mock me, sir."], ["HAMLET", ". No, by this hand."], ["KING", ". Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?"], ["HAMLET", ". Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds o\u2019 the weaker side."], ["KING", ". I do not fear it. I have seen you both; But since he is better\u2019d, we have therefore odds."], ["LAERTES", ". This is too heavy. Let me see another."], ["HAMLET", ". This likes me well. These foils have all a length?"], ["OSRIC", ". Ay, my good lord."], ["KING", ". Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamlet\u2019s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark\u2019s crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, \u2018Now the King drinks to Hamlet.\u2019 Come, begin. And you, the judges, bear a wary eye."], ["HAMLET", ". Come on, sir."], ["LAERTES", ". Come, my lord."], ["HAMLET", ". One."], ["LAERTES", ". No."], ["HAMLET", ". Judgment."], ["OSRIC", ". A hit, a very palpable hit."], ["LAERTES", ". Well; again."], ["KING", ". Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here\u2019s to thy health."], ["HAMLET", ". I\u2019ll play this bout first; set it by awhile."], ["LAERTES", ". A touch, a touch, I do confess."], ["KING", ". Our son shall win."], ["QUEEN", ". He\u2019s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet."], ["HAMLET", ". Good madam."], ["KING", ". Gertrude, do not drink."], ["QUEEN", ". I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me."], ["KING", ". [_Aside._] It is the poison\u2019d cup; it is too late."], ["HAMLET", ". I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by."], ["QUEEN", ". Come, let me wipe thy face."], ["LAERTES", ". My lord, I\u2019ll hit him now."], ["KING", ". I do not think\u2019t."], ["LAERTES", ". [_Aside._] And yet \u2019tis almost \u2019gainst my conscience."], ["HAMLET", ". Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally. I pray you pass with your best violence. I am afeard you make a wanton of me."], ["LAERTES", ". Say you so? Come on."], ["OSRIC", ". Nothing neither way."], ["LAERTES", ". Have at you now."], ["KING", ". Part them; they are incens\u2019d."], ["HAMLET", ". Nay, come again!"], ["OSRIC", ". Look to the Queen there, ho!"], ["HORATIO", ". They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?"], ["OSRIC", ". How is\u2019t, Laertes?"], ["LAERTES", ". Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justly kill\u2019d with mine own treachery."], ["HAMLET", ". How does the Queen?"], ["KING", ". She swoons to see them bleed."], ["QUEEN", ". No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink! I am poison\u2019d."], ["HAMLET", ". O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock\u2019d: Treachery! Seek it out."], ["LAERTES", ". It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in the world can do thee good. In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom\u2019d. The foul practice Hath turn\u2019d itself on me. Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again Thy mother\u2019s poison\u2019d. I can no more. The King, the King\u2019s to blame."], ["HAMLET", ". The point envenom\u2019d too! Then, venom, to thy work."], ["OSRIC", " and ", "LORDS", ". Treason! treason!"], ["KING", ". O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt."], ["HAMLET", ". Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother."], ["LAERTES", ". He is justly serv\u2019d. It is a poison temper\u2019d by himself Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my father\u2019s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me."], ["HAMLET", ". Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio Wretched Queen, adieu. You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time,\u2014as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest,\u2014O, I could tell you,\u2014 But let it be. Horatio, I am dead, Thou liv\u2019st; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied."], ["HORATIO", ". Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane Here\u2019s yet some liquor left."], ["HAMLET", ". As th\u2019art a man, Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I\u2019ll have\u2019t. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story."], ["OSRIC", ". Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley."], ["HAMLET", ". O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite o\u2019er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy th\u2019election lights On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice. So tell him, with the occurrents more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence."], ["HORATIO", ". Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Why does the drum come hither?"], ["FORTINBRAS", ". Where is this sight?"], ["HORATIO", ". What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search."], ["FORTINBRAS", ". This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?"], ["FIRST AMBASSADOR", ". The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late. The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill\u2019d, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Where should we have our thanks?"], ["HORATIO", ". Not from his mouth, Had it th\u2019ability of life to thank you. He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England Are here arriv\u2019d, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to th\u2019 yet unknowing world How these things came about. So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forc\u2019d cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall\u2019n on the inventors\u2019 heads. All this can I Truly deliver."], ["FORTINBRAS", ". Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune. I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me."], ["HORATIO", ". Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more. But let this same be presently perform\u2019d, Even while men\u2019s minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen."], ["FORTINBRAS", ". Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have prov\u2019d most royally; and for his passage, The soldiers\u2019 music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot."]]}}
