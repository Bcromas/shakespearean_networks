{"ACT I": {"SCENE I": [["LEONATO", "I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina."], ["MESSENGER", "He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him."], ["LEONATO", "How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?"], ["MESSENGER", "But few of any sort, and none of name."], ["LEONATO", "A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio."], ["MESSENGER", "Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how."], ["LEONATO", "He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it."], ["MESSENGER", "I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness."], ["LEONATO", "Did he break out into tears?"], ["MESSENGER", "In great measure."], ["LEONATO", "A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!"], ["BEATRICE", "I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?"], ["MESSENGER", "I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort."], ["LEONATO", "What is he that you ask for, niece?"], ["HERO", "My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua."], ["MESSENGER", "O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was."], ["BEATRICE", "He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle\u2019s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt.

There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there\u2019s a skirmish of wit between them."], ["BEATRICE", "Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature.

They say the lady is fair: \u2019tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: \u2019tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter?

So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy.
