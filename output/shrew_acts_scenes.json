Come, come, you froward and unable worms! My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown; But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, And place your hands below your husband\u2019s foot: In token of which duty, if he please, My hand is ready; may it do him ease."], ["PETRUCHIO", "Why, there\u2019s a wench!
