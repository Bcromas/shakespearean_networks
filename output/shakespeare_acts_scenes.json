Take you as \u2019twere some distant knowledge of him, As thus, \u2018I know his father and his friends, And in part him\u2019\u2014do you mark this, Reynaldo?"], ["REYNALDO", ". Ay, very well, my lord."], ["POLONIUS", ". \u2018And in part him, but,\u2019 you may say, \u2018not well; But if\u2019t be he I mean, he\u2019s very wild; Addicted so and so;\u2019 and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty."], ["REYNALDO", ". As gaming, my lord?"], ["POLONIUS", ". Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing You may go so far."], ["REYNALDO", ". My lord, that would dishonour him."], ["POLONIUS", ". Faith no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That\u2019s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty; The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault."], ["REYNALDO", ". But my good lord\u2014"], ["POLONIUS", ". Wherefore should you do this?"], ["REYNALDO", ". Ay, my lord, I would know that."], ["POLONIUS", ". Marry, sir, here\u2019s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. You laying these slight sullies on my son, As \u2019twere a thing a little soil\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019 working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur\u2019d He closes with you in this consequence; \u2018Good sir,\u2019 or so; or \u2018friend,\u2019 or \u2018gentleman\u2019\u2014 According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country."], ["REYNALDO", ". Very good, my lord."], ["POLONIUS", ". And then, sir, does he this,\u2014 He does\u2014What was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?"], ["REYNALDO", ". At \u2018closes in the consequence.\u2019 At \u2018friend or so,\u2019 and \u2018gentleman.\u2019"], ["POLONIUS", ". At \u2018closes in the consequence\u2019 ay, marry! He closes with you thus: \u2018I know the gentleman, I saw him yesterday, or t\u2019other day, Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o\u2019ertook in\u2019s rouse, There falling out at tennis\u2019: or perchance, \u2018I saw him enter such a house of sale\u2019\u2014 _Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses, and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?"], ["REYNALDO", ". My lord, I have."], ["POLONIUS", ". God b\u2019 wi\u2019 you, fare you well."], ["REYNALDO", ". Good my lord."], ["POLONIUS", ". Observe his inclination in yourself."], ["REYNALDO", ". I shall, my lord."], ["POLONIUS", ". And let him ply his music."], ["REYNALDO", ". Well, my lord."], ["POLONIUS", ". Farewell."], ["OPHELIA", ". Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted."], ["POLONIUS", ". With what, in the name of God?"], ["OPHELIA", ". My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac\u2019d, No hat upon his head, his stockings foul\u2019d, Ungart\u2019red, and down-gyved to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me."], ["POLONIUS", ". Mad for thy love?"], ["OPHELIA", ". My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it."], ["POLONIUS", ". What said he?"], ["OPHELIA", ". He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And with his other hand thus o\u2019er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay\u2019d he so, At last,\u2014a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais\u2019d a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn\u2019d He seem\u2019d to find his way without his eyes, For out o\u2019 doors he went without their help, And to the last bended their light on me."], ["POLONIUS", ". Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself, And leads the will to desperate undertakings, As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,\u2014 What, have you given him any hard words of late?"], ["OPHELIA", ". No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me."], ["POLONIUS", ". That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him. I fear\u2019d he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy! It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love."]], "SCENE II": [["KING", ". Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet\u2019s transformation; so I call it, Since nor th\u2019exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was What it should be, More than his father\u2019s death, that thus hath put him So much from th\u2019understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And since so neighbour\u2019d to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time, so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That, open\u2019d, lies within our remedy."], ["QUEEN", ".

Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, [_Gives a paper._] That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down."], ["KING", ".

Were nothing but to waste night, day and time Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.

Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, \u2019tis true: \u2019tis true \u2019tis pity; And pity \u2019tis \u2019tis true. A foolish figure, But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him then. And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak."], ["GUILDENSTERN", ". What should we say, my lord?"], ["HAMLET", ". Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you."], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". To what end, my lord?"], ["HAMLET", ". That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no."], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ".

I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o\u2019erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In action how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?

We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service."], ["HAMLET", ". He that plays the king shall be welcome,\u2014his Majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a\u2019 th\u2019 sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for\u2019t.

Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways."], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation."], ["HAMLET", ". Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?"], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". No, indeed, they are not."], ["HAMLET", ". How comes it? Do they grow rusty?"], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for\u2019t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages\u2014so they call them\u2014that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither."], ["HAMLET", ". What, are they children? Who maintains \u2019em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players\u2014as it is most like, if their means are no better\u2014their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?"], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question."], ["HAMLET", ". Is\u2019t possible?"], ["GUILDENSTERN", ". O, there has been much throwing about of brains."], ["HAMLET", ". Do the boys carry it away?"], ["ROSENCRANTZ", ". Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too."], ["HAMLET", ". It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little \u2019Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out."], ["GUILDENSTERN", ". There are the players."], ["HAMLET", ". Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony.

Nay, that follows not."], ["POLONIUS", ". What follows then, my lord?"], ["HAMLET", ". Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was. The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my abridgement comes."], ["FIRST PLAYER", ". What speech, my lord?"], ["HAMLET", ". I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, \u2019twas caviare to the general. But it was\u2014as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine\u2014an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved. \u2019Twas Aeneas\u2019 tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam\u2019s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th\u2019 Hyrcanian beast,\u2014_ It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\u2014 _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear\u2019d With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick\u2019d With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak\u2019d and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o\u2019ersized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks._ So, proceed you."], ["POLONIUS", ". \u2019Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion."], ["FIRST PLAYER", ". _Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks.

Unequal match\u2019d, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Th\u2019unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus\u2019 ear. For lo, his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019air to stick. So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing But as we often see against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus\u2019 pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work, And never did the Cyclops\u2019 hammers fall On Mars\u2019s armour, forg\u2019d for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus\u2019 bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.

And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What\u2019s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damn\u2019d defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i\u2019 th\u2019 throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?

Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Oh vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder\u2019d, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon\u2019t! Foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim\u2019d their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I\u2019ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I\u2019ll observe his looks; I\u2019ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil, and the devil hath power T\u2019assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me.

They say the lady is fair: \u2019tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: \u2019tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter?
